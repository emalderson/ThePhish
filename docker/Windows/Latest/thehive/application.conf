# TheHive configuration - application.conf
#
#
# This is the default configuration file.
# This is prepared to run with all services locally:
# - Cassandra for the database
# - Elasticsearch for index engine
# - File storage is local in /opt/thp/thehive/files
#
# If this is not your setup, please refer to the documentation at:

# Secret key - used by Play Framework
# If TheHive is installed with DEB/RPM package, this is automatically generated
# If TheHive is not installed from DEB or RPM packages run the following

# Additional modules
#
# TheHive is strongly integrated with Cortex and MISP.
